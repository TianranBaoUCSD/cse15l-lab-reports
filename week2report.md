## Part 3

From lab during week 2 and 3, I learned about how to log into a SSH server (both with a password and a ssh key), as well as how to create and copy files within the server. 
Before this class, SSH and remote servers were completely foreign to me, so being able to get more familiar with them in this class was really cool.
