Something interesting that I learned about in the second half of the quarter was finally learning how to use Vim. I've heard so many bad things about using vim and how unintuitive it was, and
this largely proved to be accurate. Despite this, Vim proves to be a very powerful tool that I can use on remote servers to edit code without going through the hassle of downloading it to my
computer and working with version control, so I definitely see the value in it. Being introduced to it in class also helps me get familiarized with the documentation and commands that I need to
continue practicing it on my own and eventually get comfortable with it.
